          <li>The Big D Classic is an USBC certified tournament. The tournament is a mixed handicap competition open to men and women by invitation only. Therefore, the Tournament Director reserves the right to refuse any application. Space is limited to 46 teams/184 bowlers. Teams will consist of 4 members, any mix of men and women. Partial entries will be accepted as long as they can be accommodated.</li>
          <li>Bowlers will hold harmless Big D Classic and Plano Super Bowl from anything resulting from potential exposure to COVID-19.  All bowlers must sign and agree to abide by the tournament rules on their registration form before participating.</li>
          <li>Averages, Handicap, &amp; Scores:
            <ol>
              <li>Handicap for the Tournament shall be based on 90% of the difference between the bowler’s scratch average and 235. Negative handicap will not apply.</li>
              <li>Only 10-pin averages can be used.</li>
            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>Any bowler entering the Big D Classic must use a ten-pin average acceptable to USBC.  Use the first applicable rule below to determine the entering average:
            <ol>
              <li>
                Bowlers will use a two-year combined composite average based on the USBC sanctioned 2021-22 Standard Composite book average and USBC sanctioned 2020-21 Standard Composite book average.  Resulting calculated average using number of games as the weight will be truncated at the end.  The minimum number of games required is 60 for combined composite average.  If the number of games requirement isn’t met, rule B will be applied, and the highest average will be used between rule A (21 game minimum) and rule B.
              </li>
              <li>
                All other bowlers must submit the following averages if available. The highest of these will be used.
                <ol>
                  <li>USBC sanctioned challenge or sport league composite averages from 2021-22 and 2020-21 seasons combined and adjusted to a standard basis using USBC official charts.  Minimum of 21 games is required.</li>
                  <li>USBC sanctioned 2019-20 Standard Composite book average or USBC sanctioned challenge/sport league composite averages adjusted to a standard basis using USBC official charts (minimum of 21 games).</li>
                  <li>USBC sanctioned 2018-19 Standard Composite book average or USBC sanctioned challenge/sport league composite averages adjusted to a standard basis using USBC official charts (minimum of 21 games).</li>
                  <li>If none of these averages are available, a USBC sanctioned summer 2022 league average will be considered; number of games must be submitted.</li>
                  <li>Bowlers with an average from a non-sanctioned league must submit a complete average list from all leagues bowled, including number of games, and a secretary signed letter or league sheet from the league with the bowler’s highest average. In addition, all tournament scores (IGBO and non-IGBO) may be requested for bowlers using average rule 4.B.</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
              <li>If none of the above is available, then the entering average shall be 235.</li>
              <li>
                Averages will be verified on <a href="http://www.bowl.com">www.bowl.com</a> database.  Correct USBC number must be provided on entry form.  Any averages that are unavailable or inaccurate on this site must be noted in the comments section of entry form, with separate verification provided by the league secretary (letter or standing sheet).
